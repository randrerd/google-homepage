---------THIS IS A PROJECT MADE FOR THE ODIN PROJECT COURSEWORK----


In this project the assignment was to recreate either the landing Google webpage, the search results page or both. I ended up doing both and did exactly what they asked me not to do, to be a perfectionist (even though it doesn't quite seem like it) which made me lose time in small details I shouldn't have, either way I used only HTML and CSS. I decided to only use Flexbox which I learned with the Flexbox Froggy tool. The search results page was a bit challenging but it was quite rewarding seeing everything looking pretty and right.
Anyway, I'm looking forward to continue doing these projects and start coding even more.
